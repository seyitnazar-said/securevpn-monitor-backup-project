# SecureVPN-Monitor-Backup Project

## Overview
This project provides a secure VPN service, multi-platform monitoring system, and automated backup solution. It demonstrates infrastructure automation, security hardening, observability, and cross-platform system administration.

The goal of the project was to create a fully functional environment for managing VPN access, monitoring Linux and Windows servers, and ensuring reliable backups. The OpenVPN server issues client certificates generated by Easy-RSA, while Prometheus, Grafana, and exporters collect and visualize metrics from Linux and Windows hosts. A Bash-based backup system stores local and remote copies in MinIO, with monitoring and alerts integrated into Grafana. Security measures include TLS via Let’s Encrypt, Nginx basic auth, iptables restrictions, AWS Security Groups, and automatic Ubuntu updates. The project includes automation scripts, prebuilt Debian packages, and detailed documentation for each component, making deployment and maintenance straightforward.

## Infrastructure
This project uses three EC2 instances in AWS for the OpenVPN server, monitoring stack, and MinIO storage, along with a local Windows VM for metrics collection and a management server for administration. Networking is secured with AWS Security Groups, subnets, and restricted ports. Public DNS via DreamHost points to the monitoring endpoints. A diagram of the architecture is available in `6 Documentation/images/infrastructure-diagram.png`.

## Components
- **VPN & Certificates:** Easy-RSA for certificate generation and OpenVPN server for client keys.
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus, Alertmanager, Node Exporter, OpenVPN Exporter, Windows Exporter, and Grafana dashboards.
- **Backup System:** Bash script automates backups to local storage (`/var/backups`) and remote MinIO, logs to `/var/log/backup_minio.log`, and exposes Prometheus metrics for monitoring.
- **Security Measures:** TLS certificates via Let’s Encrypt, Nginx basic auth, iptables restrictions, AWS Security Groups, and automatic Ubuntu updates.

## Project Structure
Each major component includes its own documentation and supporting resources:

- **docs/** – Guides and notes for each component, including Prometheus rules and Windows Exporter setup.
- **scripts/** – Automation scripts for installation, configuration, and maintenance.
- **images/** – Diagrams and screenshots referenced in the docs.
- **packages/** – Prebuilt Debian packages for manual installation.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the installer or install selected `.deb` packages on Linux servers.
3. Launch Windows Exporter on the Windows VM using the provided `.exe`.
4. Access dashboards:
   - Prometheus: `https://your-domain`
   - Grafana: `https://your-domain`
5. Verify backups and monitoring metrics using logs and dashboards.

## What I Learned
- Multi-platform monitoring (Linux & Windows) with Prometheus and Grafana.
- Secure deployment and configuration of public-facing services.
- Infrastructure automation, Debian packaging, and backup strategies.
- Writing clear, structured documentation for complex projects.
